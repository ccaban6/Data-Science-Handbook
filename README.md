# Data-Science-Handbook
Experimental Repository for the different chapters/topics observed in the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/).
The chapters and sections that are found within the repository may be chosen based on my interests, curiosity behind a feature, or simply for the sake of experimentation.
I'm hoping to expose myself to more modules and classes that libraries, such as Pandas and NumPy, have to offer and their applications for research and projects.
